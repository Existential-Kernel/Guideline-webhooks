If you come across a message that appears to break these rules, please report it to us by messaging one of the moderators or by creating a ticket. We may take a number of steps, including issuing a warning, removing the content, or banning the account(s) that is/are responsible. Just because a rule isn't noted here, doesn't mean you're allowed to do whatever you want. We will take action if you break any discord guidelines and ToS as well.```\nhttps://discord.com/terms\nhttps://discord.com/guidelines",
